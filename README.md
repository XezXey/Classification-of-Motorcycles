Classification of Motorcylcles Using Brand Information  with Image Processing Technique

There's 4 Step of this project:
1. Preprocessing the images(Adjust contrast and brightness)
2. extract the feature of motorcycle in the image
3. Training the data using the ANNs and SVM(Including Calculation HOG-Histrogram of gradients)
4. Compare and optimize the system
